Please do the following to run the tests.

Assumption:
ROOT=<your_azkaban_repo_dir>

1. Open $ROOT/test/jobs/system.properties to update:
   a. mail.host=<your_mail_host> 
   b. server.url=http://<your_hostname>:8081/
   c. job.failure.email=<your_email_address>
   d. job.sucess.email=<your_email_address> 

2. set ent variable HADOOP_HOME: 
   $ export HADOOP_HOME=$ROOT/test/jobs/
  Note: 
   You don't need to install hadoop. Azkaban will use the 
   included hadoop jars to run hadoop jobs in local mode.

2. Run azkaban server locally:
   $ cd $ROOT
   $ bin/azkaban.sh -j test/jobs 

3. Open http://<your_hostname>:8081/ in your browser to run 
   or schedule the test jobs:
   a. "command_ls" is a command job to execute "ls";
   b. "hadoop_wordcount" is a hadoop word count job. The input
      file is $ROOT/test/jobs/wordcount.input and output is in 
	  $ROOT/test/wordcount.output;
   c. "java_sleep" is a java job which sleeps for some time;
   d. "java_wordcount" is a java word count job which takes input
      from $ROOT/test/jobs/wordcount.input and dumps its output
	  to /tmp/dummy;
   e. "python_celsius" is a python job which converts Fahrenheit
      to celsius.
